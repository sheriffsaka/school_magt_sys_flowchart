A brief sample of a school management system flowchart for Admin, staff, students and parents
1. The admin flowchart allows Administrator to perform the following tasks:
i. Login
ii. Add users to the system.
iii. Deletes and Update users details.
iv. Add Parents, Students, Staff or Teachers and Accountant to the system.
v. Generates reports.

2. The Parents flowchart:
i. Login to the system.
ii. View student or child's records.
iii. Make payments.

3. Student flowchart:
i. Login to the system.
ii. Allowed to change password if login successful.
iii. Takes Examinations.
iv. Takes Assignments.
v. Views reports of exams.

Accountant Flowchart:
i. Login to the system.
ii. Prepares staff salary.
iii. Makes salary payment.
iv. Manages salary issues.
v. Generates reports of payments.

The system has similar tasks that are similar
hence I decided to make some of the most important
once.

the categories and their functions.![SMAAPTAL SMS Flowchart1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20608392/227770702-4eb83a90-e984-40a6-920b-749157f9509b.JPG)
